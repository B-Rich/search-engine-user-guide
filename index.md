## Guide for New Users
Approach0 is a third-party search engine dedicated to provide
better search experience for mathematical Q&A websites.
This page aims to provide new users a quick tour about
how to use Approach0 search engine.

### What the search engine actually looks for?
This search engine only indexes
[Mathematics StackExchange](http://math.stackexchange.com)
site right now.

Approach0 is a math-aware similarity search engine, which
means you type a query containing one or more "keywords",
each keyword can be either normal text or a math
expression. Then the search engine get you search
results from already indexed posts/threads which
contains the content you may find relevant to your query.

Currently it has finished indexing most posts on Math SE site.
Although newly updated posts may not be renewed in our database
immediately due to limited hardware resource we currently have,
we are trying our best to renew the index on a regular basis,
usually every week or so.

### How a search query is entered?
If you only want to search non-math terms, just type the
keywords like what you normally do on a typical search engine:


To input math keyword is also very intuitive, user does not
have to know TeX to input a math expression on search box.
Below is an example of inputting math \\(\dfrac a b + c\\):

### URL

### Copy-paste

### Advanced
